HUMAN_MESSAGE = """
TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question.
The tools the human can use are:

{tools}

RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{
"action": string, #The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
"action_input": string #The input to the action
}}
```

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{
"action": "Final Answer",
"action_input": string #You should put what you want to return to use here
}}
```

Keep in mind to always use a backslash to escape double quotes in the json blob.

CONTEXT FROM USER UPLOADED FILES
--------------------
Here is the context from the user's uploaded files (if any):

{context}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Remember to give a very detailed response.
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else, do not write any strings around the json blob):

{input}
