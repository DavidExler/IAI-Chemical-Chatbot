    "Summary of the Text

    The text describes the development of a one-pot synthesis method for creating microporous nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs) conjugated with laccase as a promising biocatalyst. The authors successfully immobilized laccase into amine-functionalized NMOFs (NH2-MIL-53(Al)) using a green synthesis approach.

    Constructed MOF-Enzyme Materials

    The following MOF-enzyme materials were constructed:

    NH2-MIL-53(Al)/Laccase: This material was synthesized using a one-pot method, where laccase was immobilized into NH2-MIL-53(Al) NMOFs. The resulting material showed good reusability, retaining 63% of its initial activity after being reused 10 times.

    Related Experiments

    Several experiments were conducted to characterize the NH2-MIL-53(Al)/Laccase material:

    FTIR Analysis: FTIR spectra showed that laccase was successfully immobilized into the NH2-MIL-53(Al) structure, with both the enzyme and NMOF remaining intact.
    Surface Area Analysis: Microporous BET analysis revealed that the surface area of the NMOF was 345.8 m²/g, which decreased to 116.1 m²/g after laccase immobilization. The pore diameter of the NMOF also decreased from 0.545 nm to 0.277 nm after enzyme loading.
    XRD Analysis: XRD patterns confirmed that the framework structure and phase purity of the NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite were retained after enzyme immobilization.
    TGA Analysis: Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the thermal behavior of the NMOF was not affected by laccase immobilization. The TG curve of the NMOF-laccase composite showed a three-stage weight loss, attributed to water desorption, laccase decomposition, and NMOF precursor decomposition.

    Comparison with Previous Studies

    The authors compared their results with previous studies on enzyme immobilization into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). They cited examples of glucose oxidase, lipase, hydrolase, urate oxidase, catalase,
