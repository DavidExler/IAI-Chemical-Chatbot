    Yes, there is at least one MOF material constructed in the text, and it contains an enzyme.

    The MOF material is ZIF-8, and it contains the enzyme urease.

    Here is the information for ZIF-8:

    Linker: 2-methylimidazole
    Concentration: 160 mM
    Metal salt: Zinc nitrate
    Concentration: 40 mM
    Enzyme: Urease
    Concentrations: 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 mg/mL (each concentration corresponds to a different material)
    Additional components: None mentioned

    Since each concentration of urease corresponds to a different material, we can consider five variations of ZIF-8:

    ZIF-8 with urease (10 mg/mL)
    ZIF-8 with urease (30 mg/mL)
    ZIF-8 with urease (50 mg/mL)
    ZIF-8 with urease (70 mg/mL)
    ZIF-8 with urease (90 mg/mL)

    The enzyme reaction used to evaluate the functionality of the constructed material is the urea detection reaction, which involves the breakdown of urea by urease.
