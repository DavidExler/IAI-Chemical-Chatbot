    Here is a summarizing paragraph of all MOF-related concepts mentioned in the uploaded documents:
    The study involves the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) including zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), specifically ZIF-8, ZIF-90, and MAF-7, using 2-methylimidazole (HmIM) as a linker and zinc acetate as a metal salt. The MOF, dZIF-8, was synthesized and functionalized with enzymes, including peroxidase (POD) and glucose oxidase (GOx), with loading efficiencies of 13.5% and 31.4%, respectively. The enzymatic reaction involved the oxidation of glucose, with reactant concentrations of 0.05-0.25 mM or 0.25-4 mM, and product concentrations of 1 mM glucose solution with 10 mM different interferents. The MOF-enzyme composite material was characterized using various buffers, including carbonate buffer at pH 8.0 and 9.0, with concentrations of 0.5 M. The study also involved the synthesis of a dZIF-8 biohybrid hydrogel using 40 mg of dZIF-8 biohybrid powders, 1 mL of 5 mM ABTS solution, and CaCl2 (60 M) dissolved into 0.05 M PAA solution.
